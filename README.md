[Type your question]: What's the specific impulse of KNSB motor?

The specific impulse of the KNSB motor is 129 seconds.

[Type your question]: How can we insulate the solid rocket motor?

The solid rocket motor can be insulated in several ways. One approach is to use a layer of thermal insulating material on the inside walls of the casing. This material has low thermal conductivity, which reduces the rate at which heat is diffused into the casing walls. Another option is to use a heat sink, which involves using a thick-walled casing made of a high conductivity material. This allows the casing to rapidly diffuse and store any absorbed heat, keeping the overall temperature of the casing low. A third method is to use a layer of ablative material, which absorbs heat as it burns away. This can be achieved by either using an ablative structural material for the casing or by applying a layer of ablative material to the casing. The ablative material decomposes rather than melts as it burns, and the resulting pyrolysis gases provide additional thermal protection by forming a protective boundary layer.
