To determine the effects of heating a sample of Dextrose Monohydrate.
Method:
A 250 gram sample of dextrose monohydrate was placed in a stainless steel bowl and was slowly heated over an electric element. Sample was regularly stirred using a stainless steel spoon. Every two minutes, the bowl and sample was briefly removed from the element and placed on a scale to measure the weight. In addition, temperature measurement of the sample was taken utilizing a K-type thermocouple. Both colour and texture of the sample were recorded.
