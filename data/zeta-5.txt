Launch Event Description
Setup went smoothly except for configuring on-board camcorder. It was difficult to read LCD screen and, as such, zoom level setting was uncertain. First attempt at launch failed, due to glitch with Launch Controller. This was resolved and motor ignited on follow-up attempt. Rocket rose rapidly skyward. After burnout, rocket continued to climb straight and true toward apogee. Following apogee, rocket began to ‘turn over’ then immediately smoke cloud from ejection charge appeared, then rocket separated into two sections. It was clear that the tether connecting the two sections had snapped. A second or so later, a second smoke cloud appeared accompanied by a ‘pop’ and the parachute was seen to eject and immediately blossom. The section with the parachute descended lazily, while the free-falling section descended in a horizontal attitude, at a moderate pace, and impacted the ground shortly after. Both sections landed roughly 500 feet downwind. Examination of the rocket confirmed that the tether has snapped due to overload (overly forceful separation event). Only damage was a broken fin.

Post-flight analysis and comments:
The issue with premature deployment experienced by flights Z-1 and Z-3 appears to have been resolved. Apogee separation and main deployment performed nominally, with the exception of the broken tether. The new larger chute deployed and blossomed nominally. The on-board camcorder functioned well and good video coverage was obtained. The hard landing may have caused some damage, however, to the camcorder, as the sound is out-of-sync and the playback rate is slower than actual.
