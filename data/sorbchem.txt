KN-Sorbitol Propellant Chemistry and Performance Characteristics

Standard Composition (65/35 O/F)
For the KN-Sorbitol propellant, with an oxidizer-fuel (O/F) ratio of 65/35, the theoretical combustion equation is as follows:
C6H14O6 + 3.345 KNO3 -> 1.870 CO2 + 2.490 CO + 4.828 H2O + 2.145 H2 + 1.672 N2 + 1.644 K2CO3 + 0.057 KOH
at a pressure of 68 atmospheres, and where the following compounds are symbolized as:
