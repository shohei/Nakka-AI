Richard Nakka's Experimental Rocketry Web Site

￼
The following listing represents books and articles that I have collected over the years as part of my technical reference library. These suggested titles may serve as useful sources of information for anyone interested in experimental rocketry, or rocketry in general. Some titles are available in any good library, others in engineering or technical libraries. Some are probably out of print, and some of the really older ones have likely been relegated to library archives. A couple have not been published, but I've included them anyway. And others are available for downloading on the web.
The list is not necessarily in any particular order.
	•	Rocket Propulsion Elements       George P.Sutton Wiley Publ. The rocket engineers bible. Describes in detail the theory of rocket engines with regard to propellant chemistry and combustion (liquid and solid), nozzle theory, and flight performance, as well as testing. Indispensable for the basic formulations regarding the engineered design of rocket motors.  Available for download at:MIT website 
	•	Rocket Manual for Amateurs       Bertrand R.Brinley Ballantine Books One of the first books published (1960) on amateur rocketry. Worthwhile reading, if only for its historical significance, and the fact that it covers a broad range of topics regarding the field of experimental rocketry (basic design, propellants, testing, launching site design, tracking and evaluation of data, etc). Tends to get carried away, however, with the safety aspect of rocketry. He probably (inadvertently) does experimental rocketry something of a disservice in the process. Well, his propellant of choice is the zinc powder/sulphur, which is probably as hazardous as amateur propellants go, simply because its a powder. 
	•	Topics in Advanced Model Rocketry       Gordon K.Mandell MIT Press Cover dynamics of rocket flight, aerodynamic stability and trajectory analysis. Intended for model rockets, but just as applicable to experimental rockets. Highly mathematical, its useful for anyone who wants to fully examine the complex nature of rocket flight. I've mainly found it useful mainly for the good section on aerodynamic drag. Includes a very good section on calculation of a rocket's CP (by Barrowman method) and CG. 
	•	Handbook of Model Rocketry      G.Harry Stine Wiley Publ. Although written for model rocket enthusiasts, this book contains lots of useful information that is just as applicable to experimental rockets, such as ignition systems, launching techniques, stability, altitude tracking, payloads, and recovery systems. And the information is very well presented and explained. 
	•	50 Model Rocket Projects for the Evil Genius      Gavin D.J Harper; McGraw-Hill, 2006  Despite its peculiar title, this book is worthwhile for those who wish to get more out of model rocketry than your average kit-builder. Welcome emphasis is placed on building parts from "scratch" as an alternative to simply buying "off-the-shelf". This approach to the hobby serves as an excellent transitional step from model rocketry to amateur experimental rocketry (AER), for those who later wish to pursue the ultimate in scratch-built rocketry. This book encourages the reader to explore beyond the conventional, through projects such as a self-made wind tunnel, launch controller, rail launcher, rocket cameras, flight computer, apogee sensors and other sensor projects. Details tend to be minimal, although this is likely intentional, leaving the reader to gain more benefits (and rewards) from the projects by using their own resourcefulness. A couple of nice touches to the book are the numerous historical accounts relating to various aspects of rocketry, and the emphasis placed on the importance of math to the rocketry hobby. 
	•	The Rocket Files   2nd Edition   Joseph T. Jimmerman This book is intended for anyone interested in general rocketry, and covers a broad base of topics. The fundamentals of rocket design are explained, which is then applied to basic model rocketry, as well as more advanced rocketry including HPR and amateur experimental rocketry. Also discussed are concepts such as staging and clustering, launch pads, payloads, experiments, telemetry and alternative rockets. Although intended primarily for those who are new to hobby rocketry, this skillfully written book is enjoyable to read even for those who are at a more advanced stage of the hobby. 
	•	Retro Rockets -- Experimental Rockets, 1926-1941      Peter Alway This hardcover book provides an overview of many key experimental rockets that were developed (and in most cases flown) by the early rocketry pioneers, such as Goddard, Winkler, Von Braun, and groups such as ARS, VfR and GIRD. Includes many historic photos and also basic drawings of these rockets. Although intended primarily for the rocket modeler, I bought this book out of my own interest in the history of technology, especially rocketry. Very interesting reading and also enlightening, especially for those of us who endeavour to design and build our own experimental rockets! 
	•	The Potassiumnitrate-Sugar Propellant       Antoon Vyverman 1978?  Well researched treatise on this propellant, covering theoretical analysis, preparation and rocket construction, as well as engine testing. Available for ordering through the VRO   website   
	•	Simulation of Potassium Nitrate-Sugar Rocket Motors       Antoon Vyverman 2002  Fascinating article that investigates the unexpected behaviour of several rocket motors powered by the sugar-based propellants. Using a specially written computer program, Tony strives to simulate the performance behaviour of these motors through the introduction of 'ignition delay', grain 'cracks' and erosive burning.  Available for download from the  Amateur Rocketry Links Library   website    (PDF format) 
	•	The Rocket Handbook for Amateurs       Lt.Col. Charles M.Parkin, Jr. 1959  This book is a compilation of articles written by different authors, and as such, the topics covered are quite diverse -- solid propellant rockets, liquid propellant rockets, satellite orbit geometry, human factors in space flight (not quite sure what this has to do with amateur rocketry...), building and testing of rockets, fuel pump and turbine design, cryogenics, etc. Most of the material is quite briefly presented and is rather elementary (except the section on pumps and turbines...which is WAY too advanced for the beginner!). However, the section on designing solid propellant rockets is quite well written, and may be of value to someone just starting out in this endevour. Bear in mind, this book is quite dated ("Man has now accepted a challenge as old as himself -- the conquest of space")! 
	•	A Guide to Amateur Rocketry       U.S.Army Field Artillery School, Fort Sill, Oklahoma 1958(?)  Certainly an interesting early handbook for designing, building, testing, and flying of amateur rockets. An aftereffect of the National Defense Education Act of 1958, which itself was largely a stunned reaction to the Soviet Union's surprise launch of Sputnik. Incredible at it may seem in this day and age, this guide was issued with the blessing of The Commanding General of the U.S. Army Field Artillery Center (`Maj.Gen. Charles P. Brown). In the preface, Gen. Brown states "The United States Army desires to extend the maximum degree of assistance to, and to cooperate fully, these budding scientists in their experimentations. To further assist our young scientists, the United States Army Field Artillery School has prepared this booklet." A truly amazing time in history. With regard to content, the booklet is largely the same as Brinley's Rocket Manual for Amateurs. As it was Brinely that started and directed the Army program for assistance and safety instruction for amateur rocketeers, Rocket Manual for Amateurs is undoubtedly a compilation of this experience. Downloadable from Aeroconsystems.com: A Guide to Amateur Rocketry 
	•	Experimental Composite Propellant      Terry W.McCreary, Ph.D., 2000  This book provides an excellent introduction to experimental composite propellants. Topics covered include preparation of a simple starter propellant (basically, AP/PBAN), basic motor construction, static testing, flight motor design, and modification of the starter propellant to achieve various goals (e.g. performance, burn rate) or effects (e.g. smoke, sparks). Includes comprehensive appendices: e.g. nozzle construction, igniters, polymer chemistry (which I found to be particularly interesting), vacuum processing, sources for materials, and lots more.  Read the Review (or order) at Rocketry Online or contact the author at prfesser@hotmail.com 
	•	Solid Propellant Rocket Motor Design and Testing       R.A.Nakka      93 pages This is my B.Sc. graduation thesis that presents the theory behind solid rocket motor design and in particular, the performance of the KNO3-sucrose powered B-200 motor with regard to theoretical v.s. testing results. Topics covered include combustion analysis and nozzle flow theory, including derivation of the equations employed in nozzle and motor design. Analysis of two-phase flow with resulting modified performance equations.

	•	Designing Rocket Motors       James E.Lanier Gas Dynamics Lab This booklet presents a condensed version of the theory of experimental rocket motor design and testing in simplified terms. 
	•	Theoretical Evaluation of Chemical Propellants       Roger Wilkins Prentice-Hall An advanced textbook for determining the theoretical performance of propellants. Sounds enticing, but much of the mathematics are well beyond my capabilities. 
	•	Propellant Chemistry       Stanley F.Sarner Reinhold Publishing Another advanced textbook for determining the theoretical performance of propellants. Has some useful information on determining chemical equilibrium of combustion products. Also, has extensive information on propellant binders, fuels, and oxidizers (solid and liquid). 
	•	Mechanics and Thermodynamics of Propulsion      Philip G.Hill Addison-Wesley Publ. Good text for studying the theoretical performance of rocket propellants and combustion, as well as nozzle flow theory. Discusses in detail the effects of smoke particles in the exhaust (2-phase flow), important for many amateur propellants. 
	•	Jet Propulsion Engines       O.E. Lancaster Princeton University Press Another good text for studying the theoretical performance of rocket propellants and combustion, as well as nozzle flow theory. Good section on burnrate characteristics of rocket propellants. 
	•	Solid Rocket Propulsion Technology       Alain Davenas Pergamon Press Another good text for studying the theoretical performance of rocket propellants and combustion, as well as nozzle flow theory. Detailed section on solid propellant combustion and internal ballistics of motors.

Indispensable for anyone considering parachute design and/or fabrication. 
	•	Fundamentals of Solid-Propellant Combustion   K.K.Kuo & M.Summerfield   AIAA publication A collection of papers dealing with the topic of solid propellant combustion, in particular, historical and state-of-the-art developments (as of 1984) pertaining to the understanding of the process. Topics covered include the chemistry of ignition and combustion of AP-based propellants, flame-spreading and ignition transient, steady-state burning (burn rate laws, influence of additives, mesa and plateau effects), various combustion models of composite propellant, metallized propellant chemistry, erosive burning, combustion instability and smokeless propellants. Although much of the mathematics and chemistry are beyond my understanding, this nearly 900 page book made for interesting "reading", as it provided valuable insight into the chemical and physical processes involved in the remarkably complex processes that occur in the burning process we take largely for granted. 
	•	Solid Rocket Propellants   K.Krowicki & M.Syczewski, 1964 Very good and comprehesive technical report on solid rocket propellants. The authors go into great detail to describe mechanisms of combustion including the role of catalysts. The principles of thrust and specific impulse are explained in a detailed and well-structured manner. Additional topics covered include erosive burning, resonance instability and its effect on increasing burning rate (I found this section to be particularly enlightening and useful information), motor construction, inhibitor selection and ignition. There is a chapter on propellant casting and molding which was of less interest, as it's geared toward large-scale production. The final chapters cover oxidizers and various binders that were in use at the time.  PDF downloadable from apps.dtic.mil: Solid Rocket Propellants (32 Mbytes) 
	•	Introduction to Fluid Mechanics       Fox&McDonald Wiley Best engineering textbook I've come across regarding understanding the fundamentals of compressible fluid flow (as in rocket nozzles).

	•	The Amateur Scientist       C.L.Stong Simon & Schuster, 1960 A collection of really advanced science projects from Scientific American dating back to the early sixties (would you believe--"an astrophysical laboratory in your backyard", "how to cultivate harmless bacteria", "how to tranquilize a rat", "peanut-butter jar nuclear cloud chamber", "a simple magnetic resonance spectrometer", "homemade atom smasher", "bathtub aerodynamics", "amateur x-ray machine", and a few "after dinner experiments", to boot ! ). And a chapter on amateur rocketry. Strictly speaking, not a lot of useful information, but I treasure my now yellowed copy of this book, despite the fact that its beginning to fall apart. The chapter on amateur rocketry lit the spark in me and set me on the road to the world of experimental rocketry.
