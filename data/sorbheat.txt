Objective:
To determine the effects of heating a sample of Sorbitol.
Method:
A 250 gram sample of Sorbitol was placed in a stainless steel bowl and was slowly heated over an electric element. The sample was regularly stirred using a stainless steel spoon. Every two minutes, the bowl and sample were briefly removed from the element and placed on a scale to weigh the sample. In addition, temperature measurement of the sample was taken utilizing a K-type thermocouple (with ice-bath reference) interfaced to a DVM. Both colour and texture of the sample were observed.  Note that the scale used was a digital "Pelouze" postal scale with a resolution of 2 grams.
