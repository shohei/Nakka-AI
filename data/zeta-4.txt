Launch Event Description
Shortly after ignition, rocket rose quite rapidly and straight vertical. Disappeared from view after burnout. After about 15 seconds, a ‘pop’ heard from apogee charge. Nothing visual, and no flashing light observed. After an additional 30 seconds or so, a second ‘pop’ heard and rocket descending by chute was spotted about ½ kilometer downwind. After approximately 15 seconds, rocket was seen to touchdown.

Post-flight analysis and comments:
Flight and recovery was nominal. Flashing LED did not prove to be a visual aid at any time during descent. Impulser motor casing suffered a slight bulge near nozzle from overheating. Thermal liner was a single ply poster board for this flight (normally two plies used).
