PHOTO GALLERIES INDEX

This page presents a photo gallery of my early rocketry work covering the years 1972 - 1986

Goddard Gallery -- Various Rocket Flights
Von Braun Gallery -- Rocket Motors and Static Tests
Korolev Gallery -- Miscellaneous Rocketry
Oberth Gallery -- Rocket Flights Chronicle  

My choice of names for these galleries pays homage to four of history's greatest rocket engineers who were my inspiration. All, incidently, started off as amateur experimental rocket builders -- Robert H. Goddard, Wernher Von Braun, Sergei P. Korolev, and Hermann Oberth.
