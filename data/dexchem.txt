KN-Dextrose Propellant Chemistry and Performance Characteristics

Standard Composition (65/35 O/F)
For the KN-dextrose propellant, with an oxidizer-fuel (O/F) ratio of 65/35, the theoretical combustion equation is as follows:
C6H12O6 + 3.31 KNO3 -> 2.116 CO2 + 2.300 CO + 4.512 H2O + 1.424 H2 + 1.655 N2 + 1.585 K2CO3 + 0.133 KOH
at a pressure of 68 atmospheres, and where the following compounds are symbolized as:
dextrose (anhydrous)
