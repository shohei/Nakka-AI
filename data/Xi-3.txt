Launch Event Description
We used our sled to haul the supplies to the launch site. Following a checklist, setup of the rocket proceeded smoothly with no glitches. The BRB was activated first. After installing rocket on pad, Eggtimer was activated, followed by the Raven. Raven beeped nine times for voltage and gave 4 positive indications for the 4 pyros. Backup Timer was then tested and confirmed to be operating nominally. For videotaping the flight, I used the hand-held camcorder (with scope tube).
 
After verifying the sky was clear, the countdown proceeded. Immediately after ignition switch was closed, motor ignited and rocket accelerated rapidly skyward, climbing straight and vertical in a stable manner. Rocket remained in sight nearly the entire ascent, thanks to the bright sun illuminating the orange-painted rocket. A smoke cloud was seen to appear at apogee and the ‘pop’ sound heard a few seconds later The smoke tracking trail was then seen as rocket began tumbling downward.  After about half minute of decent, the parachute charge was seen to fire and immediately the parachute was seen to fully blossom. The smoke charge burned out a few seconds later. The rocket had a gentle and stable descent, and landed in a snow-covered field about 2000 feet away, which was farther than expected with the light ground-level wind.
 
We programmed the BRB GPS coordinates into the hand-held Garmin unit. Landing site was indicated as 0.43 miles away. When we arrived at the location of the downed rocket, we found the rocket to be in perfect condition.  The Raven had shut off so we did not get a field-report of the peak altitude.

Post-flight analysis and comments:
The Raven, Eggtimer and backup Timer all performed nominally. Peak altitude reported by Eggtimer closely matched Raven (3189 ft. versus 3180 ft.).  All pyros had fired.
 
No valid BRB flight data could be obtained. I had forgot to power down the unit and after a few hours, flight data was overwritten (memory looping was enabled).
 
Chute deployment was fully nominal. The dual parachute tethers showed no sign of trauma or significant loading. As such, the improved venting worked well.
