Strain gage Load Cell -- FEM Verification Models

A number of Finite Element Method (FEM) models were created to verify the design methodology for the strain gage based load cell. The stress plot for two of these models is given below. Both load cells are identical except for the hole size.

The comparisons indicate that the predictions become more accurate as the hole size approaches the body width. With a relatively small hole, the design methodology tends to over-predict the stress (and thus strain) levels.
