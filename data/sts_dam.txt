This photo shows the STS-5000 Static Test Stand, taken shortly after the first static test firing of the Kappa-DX rocket motor ( KDX-001). This test, which resulted in a catastrophic failure (CATO) of the motor casing due to overpressurization, damaged the test stand. Note the three thrust struts which were severely bowed outward by the sudden release of motor pressure that occurred when the casing burst. However, the stand was easily repaired by replacing the three thrust struts and two of the cross beams, and was later used for the successful KDX-002 test.
