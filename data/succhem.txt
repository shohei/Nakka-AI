KN-Sucrose (KNSU) Propellant Chemistry and Performance Characteristics

Standard Composition (65/35 O/F)
For KNSU propellant, with an oxidizer-fuel (O/F) ratio of 65/35, the theoretical combustion equation is as follows:
C12H22O11 + 6.288 KNO3 -> 3.796 CO2 + 5.205 CO + 7.794 H2O + 3.065 H2 + 3.143 N2 + 2.998 K2CO3 + 0.274 KOH
at a pressure of 68 atmospheres, and where the following compounds are symbolized as:
