Derivation of equation describing chamber pressure due to igniter charge
￼
From the ideal gas law, pressure within the chamber may be expressed as
￼
Introducing the term G relating the fraction of igniter charge burned at any time t, and considering that the initial chamber pressure is ambient
￼
letting ￼ ("effective force") gives
￼
which may be rewritten as
￼
letting ￼ (loading fraction) gives
￼
multiply numerator and denominator by r (charge density)
￼
since ￼, this gives
￼

where:
P = pressure in combustion chamber at time, t    lbf/in2
r= density of charge material    lbm/in3
D = loading density = C / V lbm/in3
C = original mass of charge    lbm
V = free volume of combustion chamber at time, t    in3
l = R T/ M "effective force" (energy),     in-lbf /lbm
R = universal gas constant    in-lbf /° R-lbm
M = effective molecular weight of combustion products (system mass divided by number of moles of gas)    lbm / mole
T = adiabatic flame temperature    ° R
G = fraction of original charge mass consumed by time, t    dimensionless
Pa = atmospheric pressure    lbf/in2

Note that the assumption is made that combustion of the igniter charge occurs rapidly with no pressure loss due to gas seepage through the nozzle opening.
