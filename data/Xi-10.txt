Additional information
-        On a number of recent flights, parachute inflation (once deployed) had been delayed or incomplete. Incomplete inflation of the chute leads to a harder than normal landing with typically some damage to the rocket. To attempt to resolve this issue, the parachute folding method was changed. The method being employed for this flight is very similar to the Dura-Chute method.

Launch Event Description
We used our sled to haul the supplies to the launch site. The snow on the trail was hard-packed and as such, the trek was not strenuous. Setup of the rocket went smoothly, with no significant glitches. Followed checklist as usual. The BRB transmitter and receiver were activated and verified that a good GPS signal was obtained. After installing rocket on pad,  the BREO-N, Eggtimer, and then Raven were activated. Raven beeped nine times for voltage and gave 3 positive indications for the 3 active pyros. For videotaping the flight, I used the hand-held Sony camcorder (fitted with scope tube).
 
After verifying the sky was clear, the countdown proceeded. At the zero mark, the motor immediately fired and the rocket roared skyward. Ascent was mainly vertical, with a small amount of veering into the wind. Visual contact was lost shortly after burnout. Due to the grey sky, we did not expect to gain sight of the rocket or smoke trail. Instead, I monitored the BRB GPS display, which indicates altitude of the rocket. Shortly after the readout showed 4686 feet ASL (Above Sea Level) we heard a pop sound of the apogee pyro charge. I continued to watch the altitude display, which showed decaying altitude at the expected rate. As the altitude passed below the 2000 foot mark, I announced that the chute should be deploying imminently. Just then a pop sound was heard as the main pyro charge fired. We then spotted the rocket, slightly downwind from the launch pad, descending slowly beneath a fully inflated chute. The rocket descended in a stable manner, drifting with the wind, and gently touched down a half-minute later in a snow-covered field approximately 1000 feet from the pad.
 
Although the landed rocket was within view, we proceeded to program the touchdown site GPS coordinates into the Garmin hand-held unit. Indicated distance from where we were located was 0.20 miles. We headed toward the touchdown site and as we approached, we observed that the rocket appeared to be in pristine condition. Raven beeped out a peak altitude of 4168 feet (AGL). We noted that all the pyros had fired and that that smoke charge had burned.

Post-flight analysis and comments:
Post-flight examination of the rocket and data confirmed that the flight was fully successful. There was one minor anomaly, which was inconsequential to the flight success. The BREO unit was found to have powered off prior to landing. A slide switch, which serves to power the unit, was seen to have moved to the off position. A review of the BREO data indicated that this anomaly coincided with the shock associated with main separation (for chute deploy) event.
 
For the next flight, the BREO slide switch will be replaced with a toggle switch of the type used to power up the Raven and EggTimer units. Typically toggle switches are less susceptible to g-loading than slide switches.
 
The deployed parachute inflated rapidly, suggesting that the revised parachute packing method is an improvement over the previous method. The revised method will be used on the next flight.
