This website is dedicated to the memory of my mother, Anne Sylvia, and my father, Evert.
My mother taught me to have faith in my intuition, that out of failure comes strength, to not give up on something I believe in, and who made me realize that with each passing day how important it is to reflect on the joys, rather than the hardships, that daily life brings forth.
My father was an extraordinary man who dedicated his life to his family, and did everything he could to help all his children to succeed in life.
As a youth, both my mother and my father provided unwavering encouragement and support in my pursuits of my passion. They must have seen the fire in my eyes when I spoke about the rockets that I endeavoured to build. If the smoke, flame, noise and occasional "boom" gave them reason to have qualms, they never showed it, and their support never did falter. Which still amazes and impresses me to this very day.
