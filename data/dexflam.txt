A strand of KN-Dextrose (65/35 O/F ratio) propellant burning in an atmospheric burnrate test. This propellant burns in a seemingly less energetic manner than the sucrose-based propellant, as a result of a much slower atmospheric burnrate. However, theoretical performance is nearly the same.
Insofar as physical appearance, the colour of the propellant strands range from nearly pure white to ivory.
