Project Description
The underlying goal of the Sugar Shot to Space project is too loft a rocket powered by "sugar propellant" into space, officially defined as 100 km (62 miles) above the earth's surface. Inspiration for this project arose from a dialogue and ensuring exchange of ideas on the SugPro E-mail rocketry forum.
This would not be the first amateur rocket to reach that milestone, that honour having been achieved by the Civilian Space eXploration Team on May 17, 2004 with their outstanding GoFast rocket. The fundamental difference of the Sugar Shot to Space project is to achieve the goal using an honest-to-goodness amateur propellant, rather than the ubiquitous ammonium perchlorate composite propellant (APCP) that the GoFast and nearly all professional and military rockets use. "Sugar propellant", undoubtedly the most popular propellant used by amateur rocketry experimentalists worldwide due to its inherent simplicity and safety, is not a high performance propellant. Therein lies much of the challenge of this project.
Besides the extraordinary goal of sending a rocket into space, there are other equally important and more fundamental goals. This project is intended to be universal in scope with regard to involvement, and as such, participants from around the world are invited to join in this quest. It is hoped that the Amateur Experimental Rocketry community, which over the past decade has grown in size and in collaboration thanks to the internet, will bond even more closely -- to share our ideas, experiences, successes and failures. Other goals include expanded development of "sugar propellant" technology, leading to greater knowledge and enhanced safety of sugar propellant rocketry. And no one can argue that success of this project would provide incontestable legitimization of the remarkable "sugar propellant". Last, but not least, it is hoped that attention spurred by this project will promote an interest in science & technology and begin paving the way for future "rocket engineers" to take us further.
This project consists potentially of four distinct phases, progressing through initial feasibility, research and design, fabrication and testing and finally, launch. A decision will be made at the conclusion of each phase whether a go-ahead with the subsequent phase is warranted. The go-ahead decision, made by the project directors, will be based on a complete review of the project up to that point and whether the project is still on track for success in achieving the ultimate goal of reaching space.
