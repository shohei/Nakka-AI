Launch Event Description
Setup went well with no glitches. Clear sky confirmed, countdown commenced, and shortly after zero count, smoke seen at base of rocket, then rapidly rose skyward. Shortly after burn-out, parachute was seen to eject and blossom. Raven beep-out of apogee not noted.

Post-flight analysis and comments:
Parachute deployed prematurely. Backup apogee charge did not fire. Raven baro data exhibited highly anomalous pattern. Discussion of anomaly with Adrian Adamson solved the mystery of premature deployment of Z-1 and Z-3, and explained the anomalous baro data. The source of the anomaly was a result of the rocket basic design, utilizing a common compartment for the Raven and for the parachute. Under sufficiently high acceleration, the parachute will slide “downward” and act like a piston, generating a positive pressure spike in the “avbay” containing the Raven. The Raven interprets this increase in pressure as beginning of descent, and thereby triggers apogee deployment. A simple fix was implemented for the next flight. A two second time delay was added to the required condition of apogee deployment. This problem presumably did not manifest itself with Z-2 because the Impulser motor generates a more gentle acceleration than the A-100M.
