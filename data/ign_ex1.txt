Example of Chamber Pressure Calculation due to Igniter Charge Combustion

￼
 
Consider the rocket motor and igniter shown in the figure above (dimensions are inches).
The motor chamber volume is Vc = p/4 (3) 2 (12) = 85 in3
And the grain volume is Vg = p/4 (2.75 2 - 1 2 ) 11 = 57 in3
Therefore the free volume is V = 85 - 57 = 28 in3
The igniter volume is Vi = p/4 (0.5) 2 (2) = 0.39 in3
The charge material is Black Powder (non-commercial grade) with an impetus of 75000 ft-lbf / lbm
and has a mass density of 0.057 lbm / in3
Charge mass is C = 0.057 (0.39) = 0.022 lbm
Loading density is D = 0.022 / 28 = 1 / 1273 lbm / in3
Let G = 1 since we are interested only in the maximum pressure that results from the charge combustion
The ambient pressure is Pa = 14.7 psia
The effective force is l = 75000 (12) = 900 000 in-lbf / lbm
This gives the resulting chamber pressure of
