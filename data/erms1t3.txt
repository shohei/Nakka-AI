Comments
	1	The Epoch-S motor is meant for static testing to characterize propellant c-star and burn rate. Epoch-SS is meant as both a static test motor to characterize propellant Isp and thrust coefficient, and as a flight motor.
	2	Pressure spikes and regressive pressure profile for tests ERMS-1 & 2 were likely caused by a breakup of the new inhibitor material.
