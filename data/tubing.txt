Sugar Shot to Space Project
Composite Tubing for Motor/Airframe

￼ 

January 20, 2006
Our first major purchase, and a big step forward, for the Sugar Shot to Space Project!. We are now in possession of these 10.78" diameter Ameron fibreglass composite tubing pieces which will be used for important detail tests, such as:
	•	Hydrostatic test to determine ultimate (burst) strength
	•	Materials testing to determine specific mechanical & strength properties to be used for motor/airframe design
	•	Fin attachment methods testing
	•	"Short Stack" motor test -- 2 full size (34 kg) propellant grain segments
	•	Full-scale "single phase" motor test?!
If these detail tests prove the material is suitable, identical tubing will be used for the actual SStS rocket flight vehicle!
As an "experiment", the tubing has been pre-purchased (VISA) by me (Richard Nakka) prior to raising funds. Hopefully, project members & other interested donors will come together to allow me to recover the cost of this groundbreaking purchase -- $1000 USD (approx. $750 for tubing/$250 delivery).
The idea is for donors to purchase one or more $25 USD apportionments. Simply click on the PayPal Payments button below to pay by PayPal or Credit Card, or send cheque or money order to the address indicated below.
If this experiment in pre-purchasing proves successful, it will help pave the way for future key acquisitions.
