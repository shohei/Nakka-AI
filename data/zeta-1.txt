Launch Event Description
Setup went well with no glitches. Clear sky confirmed, countdown commenced, and shortly after zero count, rocket rose rapidly skyward. After a few seconds, while the rocket was still rapidly coasting skyward, a ‘pop’ heard from ejection charge, followed by a second ‘pop’. Chute deployed and rocket drifted downward, with some oscillation. Upon landing, Raven beeped out apogee at 330 feet.

Post-flight analysis and comments:
Apogee was significantly lower than expected. The backup apogee charge had not fired. Raven had confirmed, prior to flight, that all 3 charges were connected. Also, there was no Raven data captured. According to Adrian Adamson, who produces the Raven, there was a transient data recording problem. The exact cause of these anomalous events became clearer after flight Z-3.
